Depleted Uranium(DU) is a metallic material that is found and utilized after the Second World War. As a by-product of production of nuclear reactor fuel, DU is easily accessible for military and weapon production organization for many developed and developing countries. Due to its excellent characteristic in material strength and penetration capability as armor penetrators, it is heavily used by military forces around the world. However, the  material has its drawback. Due to its chemical toxicity, DU material can often harm military personnel that comes in contact with it. The purpose of this report is to introduce the basic characteristic of DU, the usage of it and the controversy about utilization of the DU material.

Depleted Uranium is uranium with a lower content of the fissile isotope U-235 than natural uranium. Most depleted uranium arises as a by-product of the production of enriched uranium for fuel in nuclear reactors and in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Enrichment processes generate uranium with a higher-than-natural concentration of uranium isotopes with the bulk of the leftovers ending up as depleted uranium, in some cases with mass fractions of U-235 and U-234 less than a third of those in natural uranium and as a result, DU emits less radiation than natural uranium. 

 Uses of DU take advantage of its very high density of 19.1 g/cm3 (68.4% denser than lead). Military uses include armor plating and armor-piercing projectiles. DU is favored for armor penetrator because it is self-sharpenning and flammable. When on impact with a hard target ,the nose of the penetrator fractures in a way that is remains sharp. The impact also release the heat that can ignite the marterial. When the DU penetrator reaches in an armord vehicle as it combusts, it will often ignite the ammo and the crew within the vehicle, causing massive damage to the unit. And at the same time, because of its high density, DU is also favored as vehicle armor, especially for main battle tanks, usually act as the core of armor sandwiched between traditional armor metal.  For instance, some late-production M1A1HA and M1A2 Abrams tanks built after 1998 have DU modules integrated into their Chobham armor, as part of the armor plating in the front of the hull and the front of the turret.
 
 Nevertheless, the use of DU is not without its drawback. Although Depleted Uranium is a radioactive material,  the primary radiation produced by DU is alpha and beta radiation that can largely blocked by the human skin or clothes. While gamma rays a a form of hightly pentrating energy, the amount of gama radiation emited by DU is so low that it does not add much to the background radiation. However, DU is a type of heavy metal (e.g. uranium, lead, tungsten) and possess chemical toxicity properties, and will cause long-term adverse health effect leading to severe organ failure when introduced into the human body in large amount. One of the main approach of such introduction is inhalation. The aerosol or spallation frangible powder produced by impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites, leading to possible inhalation by human beings. 
 
 In conclusion, due to the outstanding material characteristic of depleated Uranium, it is likely that DU will remain to be widely used in military equipments and ammunitions and continue to be favored by military organizations. However, the adverse effect of utilization of said material is too significant to be ignored and such controversy will without a doubt obstruct further implementation of DU. The future of DU remain to be determined.
